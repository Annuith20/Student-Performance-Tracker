***Student Data Analysis and Visualization***
This Python script is designed to read student data from a CSV file, perform various data analysis tasks, and generate visualizations. It utilizes the csv module for data reading and matplotlib for creating charts. The script defines a Student class and several functions to analyze and visualize the data.


**Data Input**
The script reads student data from a CSV file named students_data.csv. Each row in the CSV file represents a student's name, roll number, and grades in multiple subjects. The script parses this data and stores it as a list of Student objects.


**Features and Functions**
Calculate Average Grade: It calculates the average grade for a student.

Calculate Passing Percentage: It calculates the percentage of students who passed (i.e., scored 40 or more in all subjects).

Calculate Top Performer: It finds the student with the highest total grade.

Calculate Average Grade by Subject: It calculates the average grade for each subject.

Generate Subject-wise Report: It prints the average grades for each subject.

Generate Grade Distribution Chart: It creates a histogram showing the distribution of grades.

Generate Average Grade vs. Roll Number Chart: It creates a bar chart showing the average grade for each student.

Sort Students by Average Grade: It sorts the students by their average grade in descending order.

Filter Students by Subject Grade: It filters students who scored a minimum grade in a specific subject.

Print Student Details: It prints detailed information about a student, including their name, roll number, grades, average grade, and pass/fail status.

Generate Subject Average Chart: It creates a bar chart showing the average grade for each subject.


**Additional Output**
The script also provides additional data processing and analysis tasks, including:

Sorting students by average grade.
Filtering students who passed in physics (subject index 0) with a minimum grade of 40.
Displaying details of the top 5 students.


**Data Visualizations**
The script generates the following data visualizations:

Grade distribution chart.
Average grade vs. roll number chart.
Subject-wise average grade chart.
